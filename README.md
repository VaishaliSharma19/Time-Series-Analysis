In this repository, I am sharing my work on several projects focused on Time Series Analysis. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in using advanced statistical techniques and tools, including ARIMA modeling, to analyze and forecast time-dependent data. The repository includes detailed documentation, code, and results that illustrate my approach to tackling complex time series problems, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model development and validation. I invite you to explore my work and see the practical applications of these methodologies in various domains.
